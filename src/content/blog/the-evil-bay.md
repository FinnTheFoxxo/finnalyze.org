The war on terror that began in the early 2000s as a result of the 9/11 terrorist attacks proved to be a challenging time in America’s history—and as a direct result the war on terror claimed over an estimated 900,000 lives, without taking into account external factors such as starvation or disease. [1] During the war, the United States Intelligence Community (IC) acted upon various forms of intelligence and used several methods of obtaining said intelligence. While not all methods of intelligence gathering live up to high moral standards, one form of intelligence gathering stands out among the rest—a horrific means of dehumanizing and violating individuals in a foul attempt of gaining intelligence. These are the CIA's "enhanced interrogation techniques."

While militaristic deployments were slowly advancing through the Middle East, another situation was unfolding in Cuba. Since 2002, nearly 800 individuals have been detained at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp (GITMO). [2] These detentions all came from an executive order issued by former President George W. Bush on November 13th, 2001. The order allowed armed forces to detain individuals with a "...reason to believe that such individual,...is or was a member of the organization known as al Qaida [sic]." [3] Geographically, Cuba is not a part of the United States; however, the Cuban government has no jurisdiction over the area due to the Platt Amendment of 1903 which, among other things, granted the United States a lease agreement for a navel base off the Coast of Guantanamo Bay. [4]

In 2014, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) largely declassified a study of the CIA's detention and interrogation program. The study provides an overview of twenty findings the SSCI made during their investigation. Additionally, the document offers additional context from the late chairwomen of the SSCI, Dianne Feinstein.  Feinstein vividly recalls watching the horrific events of 9/11 unfold; seeing man and women jumping out of the World Trade Center towers to escape, and claiming that the horrific experience will live with her for as long as she lives. Feinstein would go on to state that she could "...understand the CIA's impulse to consider the use of every possible tool to gather intelligence and remove terrorists from the battlefield...," and that "[t]he Intelligence Committee...often pushes intelligence agencies to act quickly in response to threats and world events." Feinstein continues by admitting the CIA had tortured its detainees, that conditions were cruel, and that there was "overwhelming and incontrovertible" evidence to support this. [5, pp. 3-8]

The CIA's usage of torture is not an effective way of obtaining intelligence or cooperation from detainees. Records show that seven of the thirty-nine detainees subjected to torture by the CIA produced no credible intelligence, while many other detainees "provided significant [sic] accurate intelligence prior to, or without having been subjected to these techniques." Several CIA detainees subjected to torture would produce disinformation, resulting in bad intelligence. [5, p. 11] 

CIA personnel persistently claimed that the most effective way for gaining intelligence was by torture. The CIA continued to provide several "examples" on how torture provided intelligence used to dismantle terrorist plots, and how it was used to capture alleged terrorists. The CIA claimed these "examples" showed that their methods of torture were not only effective, but used to gain intelligence that would "otherwise [be] unavailable," and that the intelligence "saved lives." The SSCI reviewed twenty of the most frequent examples given by the CIA of successful counter-terrorism and found them all to be incorrect. According to the SSCI, in some cases, there was no relationship between an example and any information given by a detainee during torture sessions. In any remaining cases, gained intelligence from torture was either already available to the CIA, or the intelligence was already given prior to use of torture. The CIA would continuously omit very relevant information about intelligence gained from sources other than CIA detainees to other government officials, giving officials a false impression the CIA was gaining new and unique intelligence from their torture methods. [5, pp. 11-12] Additionally, the CIA never conducted a credible evaluation of the effectiveness of its methods, despite recommendations and many requests by the Inspector General, the National Security Advisor, and the SSCI. Internal evaluations of the program were conducted by CIA personnel who aided in the development of the program, and CIA contractors who had financial intrigue in the program's continued development. While an "informal operational assessment" was led by two senior CIA officers, those officers were not a part of the CIA's Counter-terrorism Center. The senior CIA officers concluded that it would be impossible to assess the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced measures without violating the "Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects" in regard to human experimentation. [5, p. 22] According to the CIA, detainees produced over 1500 stacks of intelligence, and at one point, around 50% of all HUMINT (Human Intelligence) reports issued were as a result of intelligence produced by detainees. [6, p. 18] 

The conditions of the facility, and the interrogations were heavily down-played by the CIA towards government officials. [5, p. 12] The CIA would reference several methods of torture in a slideshow. The CIA divided methods of torture into two categories; "non-enhanced measures" and "enhanced measures."
The CIA considers the following "non-enhanced measures" [6, p. 16]\:
* Sleep deprivation up to 72 hours,
* Modified diet,
* Loud noise/music under 79 decibels,
* Constant light, constant dark,
* Water dousing

While the "enhanced measures" are as follows [6, p. 16]\:
* Slap (opened-handed),
* Facial hold,
* Attention grasp,
* Abdominal slap (back-handed),
* Sleep deprivation over 72 hours,
* Walling,
* Stress positions (kneeling or forehead on wall),
* Cramped confinement (boxes),
* Waterboard (up to 40 seconds)

Many of the CIA's documented techniques were not approved by the Department of Justice. The SSCI states that multiple detainees were subjected to techniques that, in the context they were applied, strafed away from specific authorization. Additionally, several detainees were subjected to interrogation methods by interrogators who had not been cleared to use them.  [5, pp. 21-22] The SSCI further states that while these instances were identified, corrective action was rarely taken. The CIA would rarely hold personnel accountable for significant policy violations, inappropriate activities, or management failures. [5, p. 23]

The CIA never conducted an accurate accounting of individuals it detained, and the CIA's claims of an accounting were inaccurate. Additionally, the CIA would hold individuals who did not meet legal requirements for detention. The CIA would claim it held less than 100 detainees, and less than a third of them were subjected to torture. However, the SSCI would find that the CIA had (as of 2014) detained at least 119 individuals, at least 26 of whom did not meet the legal requirement for detention, and at least 39 of whom were subjected to torture. [5, p. 21]

Despite all of this, the GITMO facility still remains operational, and while there have been attempts by several administrations to close the facility, none have had any noteworthy success. Overall, the CIA's actions taken during the war on terror are unacceptable, and measures should be employed in the future to ensure rights for future detainees. The act of torture has no place alongside the art of intelligence, and the act of torture should be outlawed entirely.
